                        <p>The initial phase of this project involved designing GUI’s for a server and manager based on a real restaurant. This included creating a database through AWS using postgreSQL and developing the GUIs with JFrame.</p>
                        <p>A second phase involved convering the existing framework into a web-based application. We used NodeJS and React for frontend development and Prisma for database access and backend development.</p>
